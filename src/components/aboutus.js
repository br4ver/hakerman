                your friends, family, special someone ;), or yourself. This is
                what inspired us in creating gofer. To achieve this, we have
                created a mobile application (yes, another mobile application
                insert rolling eyes emoji) that connects you to your favorite
                restaurant and have your fave meal delivered to your doorstep,
                making your day a little brighter
